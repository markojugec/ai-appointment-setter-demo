# AI Appointment Setter Assistant — Demo Overview

This repository provides a high-level demonstration of how a context-aware AI Appointment Setter Assistant works for service businesses, with a focus on business coaches.

This is a **conceptual and behavioral demo**.  
It does not contain production code, prompts, or client logic.

## Problem this assistant solves

Most scheduling systems fail by:
- Showing calendars too early
- Treating all leads the same
- Ignoring readiness and intent
- Creating friction instead of commitment

This assistant is designed to **convert qualified interest into confirmed bookings** without manual intervention.

---

## What the assistant does

At a high level, the assistant:

- Verifies qualification before scheduling
- Confirms intent and urgency
- Sets expectations for the call
- Presents scheduling at the right moment
- Confirms bookings clearly
- Handles hesitation or no-book scenarios
- Sends clean booking summaries to backend systems

---

## Example flow (simplified)

```
Qualified lead
→ Readiness confirmation
→ Calendar presentation
→ Booking confirmation
→ Follow-up or reschedule path
```


The assistant prioritizes clarity and momentum while avoiding pressure.

---

## Design principles

- Qualification before scheduling
- Readiness over volume
- Clear expectations
- Respect user intent
- Reduce friction, not commitment

---

## What is intentionally excluded

To protect intellectual property and client privacy, this repository does NOT include:
- Prompt templates
- Scheduling logic
- Integration configurations
- Client-specific rules
- Production workflows

This demo exists to explain **behavior and outcomes**, not implementation.
